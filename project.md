# Selection Theorems: A Shallow Literature Review

This blog post is a shallow literature review of Selection Theorems. I hope that it can serve as a jumping-off point for myself and others looking to understand the theoretical foundations of agency.

## Article 1. Selection Theorems: A Program For Understanding Agents

A selection theorem is a statement about which properties of agents will arise given selection pressures in the environment. An example: "If a water-based creature has to swim with minimal energy expenditure, it will evolve fins and smooth skin". But more than this, the main goal is to clarify what kinds of internal structure we should expect to see in agents. What are the fundamental building blocks of agents? How do these building blocks pass information between each other? What is a good idealised mathematical model of an agent? How is a given mathematical formalism instantiated in practice?

Given these overarching questions, the true goal of the selection theorems research agenda is to de-confuse what an agent is. Tying agent properties to selection processes is a more of an epistemic strategy to guide the theory-crafting.

## Article 2. Fixing the Good Regulator Theorem
